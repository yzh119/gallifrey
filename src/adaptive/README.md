# Adaptive Polynomial Rendering

This directory contains my implementation of the *Adaptive Polynomial Rendering*(SIGGRAPH 2016, Bochang et al.) algorithm.
  
Here are my notes of this paper.

## Reconstruction Framework
$$ y(i) = \mu(i) + \epsilon(i) $$

## Adaptive Polynomial Reconstruction

## Adaptive Polynomial Sampling
